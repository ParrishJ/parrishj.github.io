# My Bootstrap 4 Demo :hiking_boot:

## Why I Made This Demo

Pursuing web and software development as a profession requires a strong set of skills that spans many different domains. As part of my ongoing effort to refine and demonstrate my skills in a number of different areas of web and software development, I will be publishing a series of projects which explore these various subjects. 

For this project, I focused on [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) 4. Aesthetics are important to any project on the web, and Bootstrap offers a powerful and developer-friendly way to create user facing content. Bootstrap’s efficient workflow, immense popularity, and responsive design inspired me to put this project together.

Because I wanted to focus on Bootstrap for this project, I decided to build out the website using plain HTML and have hosted the [project](https://parrishj.github.io/) on GitHub Pages. For my implementation of Bootstrap 4, I’ve used Bootstrap’s source files which allowed me to implement some custom theming using SCSS. Following Bootstrap’s [recommendations](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/download/#source-files), I’ve also used [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss), and the [PostCSS-CLI](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-cli) to add vendor prefixes to my final CSS file. I’m always open to feedback on any of my projects - please feel free to reach out any time to share your thoughts on my work!
